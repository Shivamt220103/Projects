Welcome to my collection of beginner-to-intermediate level **machine learning projects** built using Python and scikit-learn. Each subproject focuses on solving a real-world problem using supervised learning techniques.Project includes-

 1)- Rock vs Mine Detection (Sonar Dataset)
- **Goal**: Predict whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on sonar signal returns.
- **Model Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
- **Highlights**:
  - Numerical dataset with 60 features
  - Model trained on UCI Sonar dataset

2)-Email Spam Detection
- **Goal**: Classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** using their content.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Highlights**:
  - Text preprocessing
  - Binary classification
  - Achieves high accuracy on real-world spam data
